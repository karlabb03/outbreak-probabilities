This directory holds the package `outbreak_probabilities`.

It holds the following:
`simulate`: simulate synthetic data using epidemiological model
`analytic`: analytic solution for the outbreak probability based on simulated data
`trajectory_matching`: selects trajectories based on identical matching to given observed data
`machine_learning`: trains a ML model to classify trajectories on their outbreak probabilities
`compare`: compares outbreak probability resuls from `analycis`,`trajectory_matching`,`machine_learning`
`gui`: a simple graphical user interface
