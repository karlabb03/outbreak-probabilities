# Generate synthetic epidemic data
# Save trajectories and perform trajectory matching



# turn biological timing(days) into model weights

# Given R, how compatible is it with the observed case data? (log likehood?)
  # If the predicted λₜ closely matches the observed counts, log-likelihood is high.

# compute the probability that an infection chain eventually dies out (extinction probability for each R)

# the probability of a major outbreak, conditional on R, given 3 weeks of observed case numbers (PMO = 1 - none_prob)
  # Given R and the 3 weeks of observed cases, what is the probability that all transmission chains will die out?

# produce the overall probability of a major outbreak using the likelihood of R, the extinction probability for each R, a prior over R
  # full Bayesian integration
